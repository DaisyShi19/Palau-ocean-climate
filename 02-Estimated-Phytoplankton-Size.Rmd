## __Indicator: Estimated Phytoplankton Size__
Phytoplankton size provides insight into ecosystem productivity with larger 
phytoplankton generally supporting more productive ecosystems with larger fish. 
Some climate change projections suggest a shift towards smaller phytoplankton, 
particularly in the ocean’s oligotrophic gyres, potentially reducing food available 
to all trophic levels. Phytoplankton size varies greatly across the Pacific basin, 
with larger phytoplankton generally found at higher latitudes and closer to coastlines.  
Phytoplankton size also varies with natural climate cycles such as ENSO, with larger 
phytoplankton more prevalent across the equatorial Pacific during cooler La Niña 
periods and vice versa during El Niño.

Estimated median phytoplankton size can be derived from satellite remotely sensed sea 
surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration.  The basin-wide average (1998 – `r RptYr - 1`) 
is shown below.  The Palau EEZ is also highlighted as a spatial average (1998 – `r RptYr - 1`)
and a time series averaged over this area.  A statistically significant (p < 0.05) decline 
in estimated median phytoplankton size was detected over this area.  From 1998 through `r RptYr`,
estimated median phytoplankton size declined by `r signif(abs(delta_md50),2)` $\mu$m Equivalent 
Spherical Diameter (ESD).

# in future years.
